1. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation of Amazon's closing price during 2024.

2. Calculate the range, variance, and standard deviation of Amazon's trading volume in 2024. What conclusions can be drawn from these results?

---

3. Categorize Amazon's 2024 closing prices into three groups:  
   - **Low:** Closing price < 1st Quartile (Q1)  
   - **Medium:** Closing price between 1st Quartile (Q1) and 3rd Quartile (Q3)  
   - **High:** Closing price > 3rd Quartile (Q3)  
   Determine the empirical probability for each category based on 2024 data.

4. Create a probability distribution for trading volume in 2024 by dividing it into discrete intervals (e.g., low, medium, high). Ensure the total probability equals 1.

5. Create the following visualizations:
   - Histogram of Amazon's 2024 closing prices
   - Boxplot to analyze the distribution of 2024 closing prices
   - Time Series Plot showing closing price trends from January 2024 to December 2024

---

6. Test whether Amazon's 2024 closing price data follows a normal distribution using:
   - Q-Q Plot
   - Normality test (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test)

7. Provide conclusions based on the normality test results.

### Closing Price Categorization

**Quartile Values:**
- **1st Quartile (Q1):** 25th percentile closing price
- **3rd Quartile (Q3):** 75th percentile closing price

**Results:**
- **Low:** 63 days (25% of trading days)
- **Medium:** 126 days (50% of trading days)
- **High:** 63 days (25% of trading days)

**Conclusion:**  
50% of trading days fell into the *Medium* category, while 25% each were *Low* and *High*. Total probability sums to 1 (100%), satisfying probability distribution requirements.

### Trading Volume Probability Distribution

**Results:**
- **Medium Volume:** 50%
- **Low Volume:** 25%
- **High Volume:** 25%

**Conclusion:**  
Trading volume predominantly falls into the *Medium* category, with equal probabilities (25%) for *Low* and *High* volumes.

üìå **Q-Q Plot Interpretation**  
- Central data points align with the red line, suggesting near-normality  
- Deviations in lower/upper tails indicate skewness/outliers  
- Left tail: More low-price outliers than expected  
- Right tail: More high-price outliers than expected

- p-value = 9.915e-08 (< 0.05) ‚Üí ‚ùå Reject normality  
- W = 0.94885 suggests near-normal distribution with deviations  
- Combined with Q-Q Plot: Non-normal distribution with skewness

### Final Conclusions

1. **Shapiro-Wilk Test**  
   p-value < 0.05 ‚Üí Strong evidence against normality  
   W value (0.94885) indicates slight proximity to normality but significant deviations  

2. **Q-Q Plot**  
- Tailed deviations confirm skewness  
- Central alignment cannot compensate for tail outliers  

üìå **Final Conclusion**  
Amazon's 2024 closing prices do NOT follow a normal distribution (p-value < 0.05). Observed skewness and outliers make parametric tests inappropriate for this dataset.
